// Lookahead is a routing graph generic lookahead builder and evaluator.
//
// The lookahead data model is structured into 3 parts:
//  - Output site wires to routing network cost
//  - Routing network point to point cost
//  - Routing network cost to input site wires
//
//  If the lookahead is invoked from a routing wire to a routing wire, only
//  the point to point cost is used.
//
//  If the lookahead is invoked from an output site wire to a routing wire,
//  the point to point cost is computed using the cheapest output routing wire
//  from the current site wire and then returned cost is the sum of the output
//  cost plus the point to point routing network cost.
//
//  If the lookahead is invoked from a routing wire to an input site wire,
//  then the cost is the point to point routing cost to the cheapest input
//  routing wire plus the input routing cost.
//
//  If the lookahead is invoked from an output site wire to an input site wire,
//  then cost is the sum of each of the 3 parts.
